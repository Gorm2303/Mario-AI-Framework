    //Integrate with the Environment Interface
    //In essence, DQNAgent acts as the mediator that integrates the DQNModel and MarioEnvironmentInterface, handling both the input to and output from the neural network.

    //Ensure that MarioEnvironmentInterface works seamlessly with your DQNModel
    //Your DQN agent should use MarioEnvironmentInterface to process game states before feeding them into the neural network.
    //It should also use MarioEnvironmentInterface to interpret the network's output into game actions.

    //Integrate the DQNModel with MarioEnvironmentInterface
    //Ensure that the model receives input in the correct format from MarioEnvironmentInterface.
    //The output of the model should be appropriately processed by MarioEnvironmentInterface to generate game actions.



    //Manage state transitions
    //After each action, store the transition (state, action, reward, next state, done) in the replay buffer.
    //Call the learn method periodically (not necessarily at every step) to update the network.

    //Integrate the ReplayBuffer with your DQN agent
    //Create an instance of ReplayBuffer.
    //Use addExperience to store experiences after each action.
    //Use sampleBatch during the learning process to train your neural network.
