    //Store tuples of (state, action, reward, next state, done). Implement methods for adding experiences and sampling a batch of experiences for training.

    //Initialize Storage Mechanism
    //Decide on the maximum size of the buffer to limit memory usage.
    //Use a Java collection like LinkedList or ArrayList to store experiences. Consider using a custom class or Pair/Tuple for experiences.

    //Implement a method to add experiences to the buffer
    public void addExperience() {
        //This method should take parameters for state, action, reward, next state, and done flag.
        //Append the experience to the buffer and manage the size to not exceed the maximum capacity (remove the oldest experience if full).

    public void sampleBatch(int batchSize) {
        //This method should take an integer parameter for the batch size.
        //Use java.util.Collections.shuffle to randomize the buffer and then pick the first batchSize elements.
    }

    //Handle Edge Cases
    //Add checks to ensure the buffer has a sufficient number of experiences before sampling.
    //Manage scenarios where the buffer is not yet full with proper conditional logic.

    //Memory Management
    //Ensure that old experiences are efficiently removed when the buffer reaches its capacity.
    //Optimize data structures for memory efficiency, especially for large buffer sizes.
