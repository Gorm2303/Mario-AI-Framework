public class DQNModel {

    //Input layer (game state size), hidden layers, output layer (number of possible actions), activation functions.


    //Input Layer
    //Determine the dimensions of the game state representation (e.g., array size).
    //The input layer of your network should have neurons equal to the number of elements in the game state representation.


    //Hidden Layers Configuration
    //Decide on the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer.
    //Consider using a standard architecture (e.g., two hidden layers with 64 neurons each) or experiment with different configurations.


    //Output Layer
    //The output layer should have a neuron for each possible action the agent can take.
    //If the game has N possible actions, the output layer should have N neurons.


    //Activation Functions
    //Use activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.
    //For the output layer, consider softmax for a probabilistic approach or linear activation for value approximation.


    //Define the loss function (usually mean squared error for Q-learning).
    //Choose an optimizer (like Adam or RMSprop).
    //Compile the model with these settings.
