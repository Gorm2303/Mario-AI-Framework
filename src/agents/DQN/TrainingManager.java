public class TrainingManager {
    //Include necessary fields to hold references to the DQN agent (DQNAgent), the game environment, and any evaluation metrics.


    //Implement the Training Loop
    public void trainAgent() {
        //Manage the training loop (episodes, steps per episode).
        //Set up a loop to run for a specified number of episodes.
        //Inside each episode, run a loop for a defined number of steps or until the end of an episode (game over).
        //At each step, let the agent choose an action, execute it in the environment, and provide feedback (reward, next state) to the agent.

    }

    //Agent-Environment Interaction
    //Handle interactions between the agent and the environment during training.
    //Within the training loop, fetch the current state from the environment.
    //Pass this state to the agent to get the action.
    //Apply the action in the environment and get the next state and reward.


    //Implement the Testing Loop
    public void evaluateAgent() {
        //Similar to the training loop, but without the learning steps (no updates to the network).
        //Track the agent's performance (e.g., total reward per episode) to evaluate its learning progress.
    }


    //Implement logging and performance metrics.
    //During training and testing, record relevant metrics such as total rewards, number of steps per episode, and any other custom metrics.
    //Optionally, log these metrics to a file or console for later analysis.


    //Integrate evaluation during the training process.
    //Periodically, within the training loop, call the evaluateAgent method to test the agent's performance.
    //This helps in monitoring the agent's learning progress and adjusting strategies if needed.


    //Implement hyperparameter tuning capabilities.
    //Allow for easy adjustment of hyperparameters like learning rate, discount factor, epsilon values, etc.
    //Monitor the impact of these changes on the agent's performance.
